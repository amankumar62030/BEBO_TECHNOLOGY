"""
CSS Selectors are often preferred over XPath because:

Faster performance: CSS selectors are typically faster than XPath, especially in browsers like Chrome.
Simpler syntax: They are easier to write and understand, particularly for selecting elements by class, ID, or attributes.
Better browser compatibility: CSS selectors are well-supported and reliable across modern browsers.
No need for complex functions: Unlike XPath, CSS selectors donâ€™t require functions like contains() or text(), making them less error-prone.
