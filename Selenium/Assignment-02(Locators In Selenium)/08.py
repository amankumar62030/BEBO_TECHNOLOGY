# Question:8
# Use XPath to locate an element(Follow us on Facebook ) with a specific attribute and perform a click action.
# How can relative XPath be beneficial over absolute XPath?


import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php")
time.sleep(2)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//a[@href='http://www.facebook.com/']").click()
time.sleep(3)

driver.quit()

"""
Less prone to changes: Absolute XPath requires specifying the full path from the root (e.g., /html/body/div[1]/div[2]/a), which can break if any part of the page structure changes. Relative XPath, however, starts the path from a specific element (e.g., //a[@href='http://www.facebook.com/']), making it more robust to changes in the HTML structure.

Shorter and more maintainable: Relative XPath is more concise and easier to write and maintain, as it doesnâ€™t rely on the full document structure. It focuses on locating elements based on attributes or text content.

Easier to debug: Since relative XPath targets elements from a specific point, it's easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong (e.g., if an element is moved or added).

Improved readability: Relative XPath is generally more readable, especially when targeting specific attributes (like id, class, or href), making the script easier to understand and modify.
