# 12.	Create a simple package structure for a library called math_operations with two modules:
#     basic_operations and advanced_operations. Include sample functions in each module, such as add
#     and multiply in basic_operations, and power and factorial in advanced_operations. Provide code
#     snippets for defining these modules.


# main.py
from math_operations import add, multiply, power, factorial

print(add(5, 3))
print(multiply(5, 3))
print(power(2, 3))
print(factorial(5))
