# 8.	Define a lambda function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their product.
# Call this lambda function with sample values.

# product = lambda x, y: x * y
# result = product(5, 3)
# print("The product of 5 and 3 is:", result)


# 9.	Write a list of integers, and use a lambda function with the filter function to filter out
# only the even numbers from the list.

# my_list = [2,3,4,5,6]
# even_number = list(filter(lambda x:x%2==0,my_list))
# print(even_number)


# 10.	Create a lambda function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specified key. For example,
# given students =[{"name": "Alice", "age": 24},{"name": "Bob", "age": 22}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 23}],
# sort the list by age using the lambda function.

# students = [
#     {"name": "Alice", "age": 24},
#     {"name": "Bob", "age": 22},
#     {"name": "Charlie", "age": 23}
# ]
#
# sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["age"])
#
# print("Sorted by age:", sorted_students)
